## 📖 About The Project

**BreathNew** is a modern iOS application designed to help users quit smoking. Unlike simple counters, it focuses on the *gains* rather than the loss. It visualizes lung recovery, calculates money saved in real-time with multi-currency support, and tracks the exact time passed since the last cigarette.

Built entirely with **SwiftUI**, it offers a seamless and native experience with support for **Dark Mode** and **Localization (English & Turkish)**.

## ✨ Key Features

* **⏱ Real-Time Tracker:** Tracks years, months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds smoke-free.
* **🫁 Health Visualization:** Dynamic lung animation that fills up as your health recovers.
* **💰 Savings Calculator:** Automatically calculates money saved based on user inputs.
* **🌍 Multi-Currency Support:** Support for USD ($), EUR (€), GBP (£), and TRY (₺).
* **🇹🇷/🇬🇧 Localization:** Full support for Turkish and English languages.
* **⚙️ Customizable Settings:** Users can edit quit dates, pack prices, and habits.
